        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a final semester student at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology. I'm completing my <b>Bachelor of Science in Engineering</b> degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I'm passionate and motivated to work and develop new skills in Software Engineering and Machine Learning domains. 
        </p>

        <p>
        During my time in university, I have participated in sports programming, developed several Android and web-based applications and conducted my thesis work using different Deep Learning techniques. I have solved several problems and took part in programming contests in Codeforces, Hackerrank, SPOJ, UVA and on other platforms which helped me to sharpen my analytical skills. Besides academic syllabus, I have joined several training programs and completed courses to develop and concrete different skills. I love to keep learning and experiment with what I am learning. I try to help others to spread my knowledge and try to learn from others also.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have been participating in different co-curricular activities and social servicing since my college life. In different times I acted on different leading roles which helped me to develop several soft skills like leadership, management etc.
        </p>

        <p>
        I love to work in a co-operative workspace where I can make the best use of my skills to solve challenging and real-life problems with continuous learning opportunities.
